## About This Repo

Documenting my solutions and progress for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). This is my first time attempting the challenge. 

I'm using Python <img src="images/python.svg" width="25" height="25" alt="Python symbol" />, a language I don't use very often - I typically reach for R <img src="images/R_logo.png" alt="R symbol" width="25" height="25" /> or Javascript <img src="images/javascript.svg" width="25" height="25" alt="Javascript symbol" /> - and am using this as a chance to brush up and hopefully learn some new tricks. I'm running Python 3.12 through Visual Studio Code <img src="images/vscode.svg" width="25" height="25" alt="VS Code symbol" />.

Although I'm mainly focused on making it work and finding a solution, I'll probably come back once or twice to refactor the more interesting/challenging puzzles, or to try a different approach with performance benchmarks.
